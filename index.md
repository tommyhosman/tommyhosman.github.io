### Current work

I am the senior systems engineer at Leigh Hochberg’s BrainGate lab at Brown University.


My work allows me to focus on many interesting goals including:
  - Work with lab members to help them accomplish their projects.
  - Develop decoding methods for human intracortical brain computer interfaces  
  - Create new engineering methods to enable online closed loop wireless research and within-home iBCI use.


### Research interest
I’m interested in studying neural ensembles to understand the principles of flexible movement and information encoding.

### Lesiure
Outside of research, I like to bake, surf, climb, and be in the mountains.
