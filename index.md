**Senior systems engineer at Leigh Hochberg’s BrainGate lab at Brown University.**

I work with lab members to help them accomplish their projects and develop decoding methods for human intracortical brain computer interfaces. 

I’m interested in studying neural ensembles to understand the principles of flexible movement and information encoding.


Outside of research, I like to bake, surf, climb, and be in the mountains.
